'''
    this code is based on:
        https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/turn-images-to-ascii-art-using-python
        https://github.com/mdq3/terminal-animation

    you can set the aspectratio of the gennerated ascii image
        by changing the value of "scale = " in def scale(image)
    it hase a blach and white mode
        you can set the thresh hold

    it workes by:
    converting all Images in a folder to asci.txt images and saves them in a folder.
        it doas so by asii() and scale()
    then it adds all Images to a animation file.py calles ohmy.py
        it doas so by calling ohmy()
